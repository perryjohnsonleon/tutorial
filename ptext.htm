 This page is dedicated to Short Stories and to those interested in reading light prose. 
 Fewer and fewer people these days read stories. This is unfortunate. 
 So only the lucky few will experience the joy that reading such fine work can give. 
 The goal of this page is to give a nice cross section of this kind of stories in the hope 
 that these stories will excite these people into rediscovering this excellent source of entertainment.
 The short story is a literary genre. It is usually fictional, narrative prose and tends to be 
 more concise and to the point than longer works of fiction. These stories have their origins 
 in oral story-telling traditions and the prose anecdote, a swiftly-sketched situation that comes
 rapidly to its point. The history of this kind of stories dates back to the oral story-telling traditions. 
 Modern trend in them emerged as their own genre in the early 19th century. They tend to be less complex 
 than novels. Usually, a short story will focus on only one incident, has a single plot, a single setting,
 a limited number of characters and covers a short period of time.
 It is our hope that our visitors, the schools and the teaching community and the parents would welcome this
 new page on Short Stories with enthusiasm.
 We shall be grateful for constructive suggestions from all of you with a view to the improvement of this page.
 In case, you know any short story which you want to be published in this page, you can send that story to us. 
 Due acknowledgement will be given to the sender.
